Creating a Next.js project that focuses on utilizing the /app directory with an emphasis on layout files, navigation, and the useRouter hook can be a great way to understand how to structure applications for scalability and maintainability. This assignment will guide you through setting up a Next.js project that includes a common header and footer across the application, demonstrates the use of nested layouts, and incorporates up to six routes with nested routes to practice advanced routing techniques.

Build a Next.js application that includes:
A global layout with a common header and footer.
Up to six routes, including nested routes.
Use Link tag for navigation.
Use of useRouter for navigating programmatically .
Practice with nested layouts for specific page groupings.
Tailwind Styling:
Create a navbar and style it using flex-box
Style header, footer and main content division using flex-box
Going into nested layouts, create a separate style sheet for one of the nested layout.
Style your link tags and route page files with some basic tailwind classes using tag, class and id selectors. You can also use modifiers if you wish to.
